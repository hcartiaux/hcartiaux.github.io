[Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) is a book which provides step-by-step instructions for building a GNU/Linux system entirely from source code.

I've always wanted to build my own LFS, to improve my understanding of GNU/Linux system architectures, but at the same time, I don't want to break my laptop.
I'll describe in this post all the deviations from the book to build and boot a LFS virtual machine.

<!--more-->

Let's start with [LFS v12.2-systemd](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.2-systemd/index.html).

I've chosen the systemd variant to learn new things about... systemd, which is now the industry standard in the Linux world.
The main release of LFS is based on System V init scripts. You may consider it if you want to develop your shell scripting skills, and acquire knowledge which is still relevant, at least in the BSD world.

## Pre-requisites

I work on Archlinux, I've only installed `qemu-base`, which includes the package `qemu-img`.

There are several ways of mounting a `qcow2` file, I'll use `qemu-nbd` because it works perfectly for this task.
I've ruled out `libguestfs` (command `guestmount`), which uses `fuse` (file system in user space) because it seems to have difficulties to preserve file ownership information.

## Creating a New Partition - Section 2.4

As root, create the `qcow2` disk file `lfs.qcow2`.

```bash-session
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /root/lfs.qcow2 20G
Formatting 'lfs.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 cluster_size=65536 extended_l2=off compression_type=zlib size=21474836480 lazy_refcounts=off refcount_bits=16
```

Load the `nbd` kernel module ("network block device"), and bind the disk file to `/dev/nbd0`.

```bash-session
modprobe nbd max_part=8
qemu-nbd --connect /dev/nbd0 /root/lfs.qcow2
```

Verify that the size is consistent

```bash-session
lsblk /dev/nbd0
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
nbd0  43:0    0  20G  0 disk
```

Let's create the partition layout with `fdisk`:

* DOS (MBR)
* root partition: 18GB, `ext4`
* swap: 2GB

```bash-session
fdisk /dev/nbd0

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.40.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

{{< callout emoji="⚠" text="If you want to configure the system for UEFI with a GPT-formatted disk, the recommended size of the EFI partition (1MB) is way too small, it will cause issues later when installing the boot loader. Choose 100MB instead" >}}


## Creating a File System on the Partition - Section 2.5

Note that the root partition is `/dev/nbd0p1`, and the swap partition is `/dev/nbd0p2`.

```bash-session
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nbd0p1
mke2fs 1.47.1 (20-May-2024)
Discarding device blocks: done
Creating filesystem with 4718592 4k blocks and 1179648 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 61312e87-a920-49f0-8391-042532d7dd8e
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
        4096000

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

# mkswap /dev/nbd0p2
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 2 GiB (2146430976 bytes)
no label, UUID=c187d56b-873e-47d6-b793-9f5578275ed4
```

## Setting the $LFS variable - Section 2.6

This is a paraphrase, but do not forget this variable!

Set the `$LFS` variable, we will work exclusively in this directory.

```bash-session
export LFS=/mnt/lfs
```

Executing the next commands without setting the `$LFS` variable will likely destroy the host system sooner or later.

## Mounting the New Partition - Section 2.7

```bash-session
mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/nbd0p1 $LFS
```

At this point, you can proceed to build the cross toolchain and temporary tools until Section 7.3.

## Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems - Section 7.3

This is a copy paste from the documentation.

```bash
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev
mount -vt devpts devpts -o gid=5,mode=0620 $LFS/dev/pts
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs tmpfs $LFS/run
if [ -h $LFS/dev/shm ]; then
  install -v -d -m 1777 $LFS$(realpath /dev/shm)
else
  mount -vt tmpfs -o nosuid,nodev tmpfs $LFS/dev/shm
fi
```

Because we use `qemu-nbd`, if you interrupt the build process and suspend/power off your laptop,
partitions must be properly unmounted and the `/dev/nbd0` block device must be disconnected, like in Section 7.13.
To resume, the `qcow2` file must be reconnected to `/dev/nbd0` block device like in Section 2.4, the root partitions must be remounted like in Section 2.7, and the virtual file systems remounted as described above.


## Entering the Chroot Environment - Section 7.4

At this point, the environment can be chrooted, which is an important milestone :)

```bash
chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i   \
    HOME=/root                  \
    TERM="$TERM"                \
    PS1='(lfs chroot) \u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin     \
    MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"      \
    TESTSUITEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)" \
    /bin/bash --login
```

## Cleaning up and Saving the Temporary System - Section 7.13

We can backup the `qcow2` image, so that it is easy to rollback in the event of a catastrophic failure in the next sections.
Unmount all the file systems and disconnect the `/dev/nbd0` block device.

```bash-session
mountpoint -q $LFS/dev/shm && umount $LFS/dev/shm
umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/{sys,proc,run,dev}
umount $LFS
qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
/dev/nbd0 disconnected
```

The `qcow2` file can now be copied safely.

```bash-session
cp /root/lfs.qcow2 /root/lfs.bkp.qcow2
```

## Beginning Section 8

Re-enter the chroot, follow the commands given in Sections 2.4, 2.7, 7.3 and 7.4.

## Creating the `/etc/fstab` file - Section 10.2

Because we use `virtio` with `qemu`, the local disk will be known as `/dev/vda` after boot.
The file `/etc/fstab` must be updated accordingly.

```
# Begin /etc/fstab

# file system  mount-point  type     options             dump  fsck
#                                                              order

/dev/vda1      /            ext4     defaults            1     1
/dev/vda2      swap         swap     pri=1               0     0

# End /etc/fstab
```

## Using GRUB to Set Up the Boot Process - Section 10.4

### Setting Up the Configuration - Section 10.4.3

Install to `/dev/nbd0`, do not touch your own hard disk as suggested in the documentation!

```bash-session
grub-install /dev/nbd0
```

### Creating the GRUB Configuration File - Section 10.4.4

Note that I've updated the root variable (`hd0,1`) to point to the first partition of the first first, and the root parameter (`root=/dev/vda1`) in the linux command line.

```bash-session
cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << "EOF"
# Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set default=0
set timeout=5

insmod part_gpt
insmod ext2
set root=(hd0,1)

menuentry "GNU/Linux, Linux 6.10.5-lfs-12.2-systemd" {
        linux   /boot/vmlinuz-6.10.5-lfs-12.2-systemd root=/dev/vda1 ro
}
EOF
```

## Rebooting - Section 11.3

Exit the chroot, unmount the file systems.

```bash-session
umount -v $LFS/{dev/pts,dev/shm,sys,proc,run,dev,}
```

The `nbd` driver won't be needed anymore.

```
qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
modprobe -rv nbd
```

## Conclusion

Boot the system using `qemu`

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu host -machine type=q35,accel=kvm -m 2048 -snapshot -drive if=virtio,format=qcow2,file=lfs.qcow2
```

Et voilà!

![GRUB menu in QEMU](qemu-grub.png)
![TTY in QEMU](qemu-lfs.png)

It has been a very smooth experience, smoother than I expected.
Note that the content of the root partition could just be rsync'ed to a real partition, the only requirement would be to adapt the `fstab` (Section 10.2) and GRUB configuration (Section 10.4.3).

I now have a functional LFS virtual machine, which is easy to copy and snapshot before experimenting and breaking everything :)
